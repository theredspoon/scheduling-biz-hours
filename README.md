# Scheduling Business Hours

This is intended as a simple test to demonstrate a working knowledge of React and Redux. The page implements the following functionality:
- uses React for rendering and Redux for state management
- a time picker for the Start / End Times
- redux-form handling form logic
- clean, basic styling (with react-bootstrap)
- form validation with redux-form: all fields are required and the times are in the correct format (12-hour)
- follows a template API and wireframe documentation
